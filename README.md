# Healthcare Dataset – SQL Analysis

This project uses the **Healthcare Dataset** from Kaggle to perform SQL-based data analysis. The queries cover patient demographics, medical conditions, hospital performance, billing trends, and more. The goal is to demonstrate SQL for analytics while highlighting meaningful healthcare insights.

## Key Areas of Analysis
1. **Patient Demographics & Stats**  
   Basic queries to count records, find min/max/average age, and study patient distribution by age.

2. **Medical Conditions & Prescriptions**  
   Explored most common health issues, medications prescribed, and their frequencies.

3. **Insurance & Hospital Preferences**  
   Ranked insurance providers and hospitals by patient count, offering insights into coverage and facility popularity.

4. **Financials & Hospital Stays**  
   Analyzed billing amounts by condition, calculated stay durations, and compared hospital efficiency.

5. **Blood Type & Donation Matching**  
   Studied blood type distributions and implemented a stored procedure to match universal donors and recipients.

6. **Admissions by Year & Billing by Insurer**  
   Checked hospital admissions for 2024–2025 and examined billing differences across insurers.

7. **Patient Risk Categories**  
   Categorized patients into risk levels (high/medium/low) based on conditions and test results for quick status assessment.

## Dataset Columns
- **Name** – Patient’s full name  
- **Age** – Age in years  
- **Gender** – Male / Female  
- **Blood Type** – e.g. A+, O-  
- **Medical Condition** – Primary diagnosis (e.g. Diabetes, Asthma)  
- **Date of Admission** – Hospital admission date  
- **Doctor** – Attending physician  
- **Hospital** – Facility where admitted  
- **Insurance Provider** – Patient’s insurance company  
- **Billing Amount** – Total charges during admission  
- **Room Number** – Assigned hospital room  
- **Admission Type** – Emergency, Elective, or Urgent  
- **Discharge Date** – Date of discharge  
- **Medication** – Prescribed drug (e.g. Aspirin, Ibuprofen)  
- **Test Results** – Normal, Abnormal, or Inconclusive  

## Summary
The dataset enables SQL-driven insights into healthcare patterns including patient profiles, disease frequency, hospital performance, insurance coverage, billing, and risk assessment. It’s a solid base for practice in SQL analytics and reporting.
